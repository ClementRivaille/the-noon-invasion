FSFT Electric Guitar Clean
--------------------------

Version 2020-02-26

This sound bank is assembled by roberto@zenvoid.org for the FreePats project,
using sound samples from the "FS Fender Telecaster Electric Guitar Bridge
Pickup Direct In" by FlameStudios:
http://www.flamestudios.org/free/GigaSamples

Contains a small subset of samples from the original GIG file. It is a
variation of the FSFT Electric Guitar Direct sound bank. Samples had been
processed trough Guitarix virtual amplifier to create a clean guitar sound.
There are other versions of this soundfont in the FreePats web site:

I want to thank Gary from FlameStudios for answering to my email and giving
permission to distribute his samples under the FreePats GPL special exception.
